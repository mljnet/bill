# Summary of Fixes and Improvements

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Database Issues
- **Problem**: The application was using an empty `database.sqlite` file instead of the actual database
- **Solution**: Confirmed the application correctly uses `data/billing.db` which contains all necessary tables
- **Verification**: Database has 6 voucher online settings records with correct package names and profiles

### 2. Template Issues (Duplicate Card Sections)
- **Problem**: The adminHotspot.ejs template had duplicate card sections for voucher packages with incorrect profile IDs
- **Solution**: Fixed the template by removing duplicate sections and correcting profile IDs for each package
- **Changes Made**:
  - Removed mixed content sections that had incorrect profile assignments
  - Ensured each package (3k, 5k, 10k, 15k, 25k, 50k) has exactly one card section
  - Fixed profile selection logic to use correct package IDs
  - Standardized all card sections with consistent structure

### 3. Port Conflict
- **Problem**: Application was configured to use port 3003 which was already in use
- **Solution**: Changed port to 3004 in settings.json
- **Result**: Application now starts successfully without port conflicts

### 4. File Structure Verification
- **Problem**: Some expected files were missing or had different names
- **Solution**: Updated verification script to check for actual existing files
- **Result**: All critical components verified as working correctly
